         <h3 style="font-style: italic;text-decoration: underline;">Story of Apache </h3>
      <p>Apache
            No doubt web is running on:  (Hyper Text Markup Language); HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer
            Protocol); 
            and URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)  or also known as URL. But 
            there is no doubt that all these web pages or protocols can’t run 
            without web servers Or it nothing wrong to say that web pages are 
            served by web servers. Web server stands for serving as a host to 
            web pages. Moreover, it can also be define as the software which 
            provide web content to the user or system. The web server which host the 
            web can have two types of role i.e. virtual or physical. 
            Most of them comes with both depends upon the security requirement 
            ad infrastructure of the organization. Moreover, using a particular 
            kind of server describe the which kind of web server you should use.
            Such as if you are using a window system, the web server which is 
            perfect for window is IIS (internet information system).
            On the other hand if you are using a Linux distribution, Apache, 
            Lite speed , NGINX will be perfect. So it is completely depend how 
            we are trying to accomplish.</p>
      
           <p>Apache and iis both have there own positive and negative points.
           If one server have strong than it have some weakness as well.  
           As nothing comes in proper package these days. Before choosing a server
           we should go through all the important aspects of the webs server 
           and than make a decision. If I put flashlight on the positive and 
           negative aspects of two most popular servers of the contemporary 
           era, you can see  both have some boon and bane. Apache can define as 
           the foundation of software which provides open source software 
          which run web server. HTTP servers are the primary product of Apache 
          which become more popular these days. Apache Provides a free platform 
          as it is  completely free. Moreover it comes with totally free server LAMP 
          (  Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). Other thing about Apache is that it is 
          good for those who would like to wait to ask for answers. 
          In addition of these, as Apache is the open source  and works with 
          almost all operating system it seems secure in case of threat of 
          virus , malware, Trojans etc. Apache can run in many operating system ( Kabir 1998).
          If we consider the popularity of the Apache server it is the number 
          one server these days which is hosting the maximum number of sites. 
          Apache is the server which is running running 38.60 % shares of all 
          sites, 52.44% shares of active sites and 53.44% of top million busiest sites.  
          There are some popular sites which are using Apache and 
          these are Baidu, Wikipedia, PayPal, Apple, Huffington Post etc. </p>
          <p>On the other side of the coin Apache have so me disadvantages as 
          well  as it is a process base server which means each connection needs
          a thread which can incur significant overhead. Moreover, other 
          disadvantage of this is that it is manytimes unable to provide proper
          service because of traffic on server and shows delay in dipalying 
          something.( Lu  Abdelzaber, Stankovic,  Son 2001)
        
         
	 
        To put in a nutshell, Apache  have strongness and weekness by themselves.
        Moreover, after checking all the advantages and disadvantages of
         web servers , apache web server is more convenient. As apache provide more safe service.
